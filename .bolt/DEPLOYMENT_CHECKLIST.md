## üéØ Demo Script (3 minutes)

**Minute 1: Overview**
- Login as HR
- Dashboard: "This is our HRMS system with 6 employees, 3 projects"
- Quick tour of navigation

**Minute 2: AI Features**
- Onboarding: "Let's generate tasks for our new developer"
  - Click Generate, show fallback indicator
  - Explain: "In production, this would use GPT-4"
- Performance: "Check attrition risk for John"
  - Show risk score and factors

**Minute 3: Skills Matching**
- Allocations: "We need engineers for AI project"
  - Click Suggest Candidates
  - Show match scores: "Token overlap + availability"
  - Explain: "Real version uses embeddings"
- Wrap up: "All features work offline, audit logs track AI usage"

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **TypeScript warning in API**: @types/uuid not installed in Docker
   - **Impact**: None (runtime works fine)
   - **Fix**: Add to api/package.json devDependencies

2. **AI service always returns fallback**
   - **Expected**: Stubs are intentional
   - **Upgrade**: Replace in ai-service/main.py
