# Performance Analysis Module - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Performance Analysis module for the HRMS application featuring detailed performance metrics tracking, six distinct professional visualizations, and a Python-powered hexagonal radar chart.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database & Models

#### Employee Model (`api/src/models/Employee.ts`)
- Added `attendance` array field to track daily attendance records
- Each record contains: date, status (Present/Late/Absent)

#### OnboardingTask Model (`api/src/models/OnboardingTask.ts`)
- Added `startDate` field to track when tasks begin
- Enables calculation of task completion times

### 2. Seed Data (`api/src/scripts/seed.ts`)
- Expanded from 6 to 24+ employees with diverse roles and departments
- Generated rich historical data spanning 12-18 months including:
  - Multiple performance reviews per employee (up to 3 reviews each)
  - Comprehensive attendance records (Present/Late/Absent)
  - Onboarding tasks with start and completion dates
- Automated attendance generation with realistic patterns (85% present, 10% late, 5% absent)
- Performance scores with trends and variations across review periods

### 3. Backend API

#### New Route: Performance Analysis (`api/src/routes/performanceAnalysis.ts`)
Created two endpoints:

**GET /api/performance-analysis/employees**
- Returns list of all employees for dropdown selection
- Includes: employeeId, name, jobTitle, department, status

**GET /api/performance-analysis/:employeeId**
- Aggregates comprehensive performance data for a single employee
- Returns:
  - Employee details
  - Performance history with scores over time
  - Attendance statistics (total days, percentages, monthly breakdown)
  - Task statistics (completion rates, average time)
  - Core competencies (6 metrics for radar chart)
  - Latest performance review details

#### API Integration (`api/src/index.ts`)
- Registered new performance analysis routes

### 4. Python AI Service (`ai-service/`)

#### Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- Added matplotlib==3.8.2 for chart generation

#### New Endpoint (`main.py`)
**POST /ai/generate-performance-radar**
- Accepts 6 competency scores (technical, communication, teamwork, initiative, leadership, punctuality)
- Generates professional hexagonal radar chart using matplotlib
- Returns base64-encoded PNG image with data URL
- Styled with professional colors and clear labeling

### 5. Frontend

#### New Dependencies
- Installed `recharts` for React chart visualizations

#### New Page: Performance Analysis (`src/pages/PerformanceAnalysis.tsx`)
Comprehensive dashboard featuring:

**Employee Selection**
- Dropdown to select from 20+ employees

**Summary Cards**
- Attendance Rate (%)
- On-Time Completion Rate (%)
- Average Task Completion Time (hours)
- Latest Performance Score

**Six Visualizations:**

1. **Performance Radar Chart (Hexagonal)**
   - Generated by Python AI service
   - Shows 6 core competencies in spider/radar format
   - Professional design with blue color scheme

2. **Historical Performance (Line Chart)**
   - Tracks average performance scores over multiple review periods
   - Shows performance trends over time

3. **Monthly Attendance Summary (Stacked Bar Chart)**
   - Displays Present/Late/Absent counts by month
   - Last 6 months of data
   - Color-coded: Green (Present), Orange (Late), Red (Absent)

4. **Task Completion Status (Doughnut Chart)**
   - Shows distribution: On Time, Delayed, Pending
   - Visual percentage breakdown

5. **Average Task Completion Time (Horizontal Bar Chart)**
   - Compares employee's average to team average
   - Benchmarks performance against standards

6. **Performance Score Breakdown (Horizontal Bar Chart)**
   - Individual bars for each competency
   - Based on latest performance review

**Latest Review Summary**
- Displays strengths, areas for improvement, and goals

#### Navigation Updates
- Added "Performance Analysis" link in sidebar (`src/components/Layout.tsx`)
- Integrated routing in main App component (`src/App.tsx`)

## API Endpoints

### Performance Analysis Endpoints
- `GET /api/performance-analysis/employees` - List all employees
- `GET /api/performance-analysis/:employeeId` - Get detailed performance data

### AI Service Endpoints
- `POST /ai/generate-performance-radar` - Generate radar chart image

## Running the Application

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
cd api
npm run seed
```
This will create 24+ employees with rich performance history.

### 2. Start Backend API
```bash
cd api
npm run dev
```
Runs on http://localhost:4000

### 3. Start Python AI Service
```bash
cd ai-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Runs on http://localhost:8001

### 4. Start Frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```
Runs on http://localhost:5173

### 5. Access the Feature
1. Login with credentials:
   - Email: `admin@hrms.demo`
   - Password: `demo123`
2. Click "Performance Analysis" in the sidebar
3. Select an employee from the dropdown
4. View comprehensive performance visualizations

## Technical Highlights

### Data Aggregation
- Efficient MongoDB queries with population
- Pre-calculated statistics for fast loading
- Monthly attendance breakdowns
- Task completion time calculations

### Visualization Libraries
